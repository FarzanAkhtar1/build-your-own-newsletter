## Background
Newsletters have made a resurgence in popularity over the past few years, as people turn away from general media (TV, newspapers, news sites), they look for alternatives. And newsletters have filled this gap by providing more niche perspectives which also allows the user to pick and choose what they read by subscribing to many newsletters.

However, many areas are extremely broad (Technology, science, finance) and it can be difficult to find newsletter which only present information regarding a specific topic or area. In this case I will be exploring the blockchain and crytocurrency space which is home to hundreds of blockchains and thousands of coins/tokens across them.

The aim to to build a proof-of-concept for a newsletter which enables users to choose which blockchain news they recieve. For example, one user may only want news regarding Bitcoin, however another user may want news focusing on Ethereum, Algorand, Cardano, or any other coin. Each user will choose what tokens they want to see and only recieve news focused on that.
